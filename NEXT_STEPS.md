## Immediate Actions (Today/This Week)

1. **Test the application thoroughly** - Use the testing checklist
2. **Fix any critical bugs** found during testing
3. **Set up automated tests** - Start with auth and CRUD operations
4. **Implement rate limiting** - Protect against abuse
5. **Review security** - Ensure all inputs are sanitized
6. **Add error logging** - Set up Sentry or similar tool
7. **Write API documentation** - Document all endpoints
8. **Create user guide** - Basic usage instructions

## Quick Wins (Easy Tasks, High Impact)
