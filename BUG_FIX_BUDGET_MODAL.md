# Bug Fix: Budget Modal Auto-Opening Issue

## Problem
When clicking on the "Manage Budgets" tab under the Budgets menu, the "Create New Budget" modal was automatically opening, which was unintended behavior.

## Root Cause
The `Budgets.vue` component was passing an `autoOpenCreate` prop to the `BudgetList` component. This prop was intended only for quick actions (when navigating with `?action=create` query parameter), but the reactive state was causing the modal to open every time the component mounted or the tab was switched.

## Solution
Removed the unnecessary auto-open functionality:

1. **Removed the prop** from BudgetList component
2. **Simplified Budgets.vue** to only handle tab switching for quick actions
3. **Removed auto-open logic** from BudgetList's onMounted hook

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/views/Budgets.vue`
**Changes:**
- Removed `shouldAutoOpenCreate` ref
- Removed `:auto-open-create` prop binding from BudgetList
- Simplified quick action logic to only switch tabs

**Before:**
```vue
<BudgetList v-else :auto-open-create="shouldAutoOpenCreate" />

const shouldAutoOpenCreate = ref(false)
onMounted(() => {
  if (route.query.action === 'create') {
    activeTab.value = 'manage'
    shouldAutoOpenCreate.value = true
    // ...
  }
})
```

**After:**
```vue
<BudgetList v-else />

onMounted(() => {
  if (route.query.action === 'create') {
    activeTab.value = 'manage'
    router.replace({ path: route.path })
  }
})
```

### 2. `frontend/src/components/budgets/BudgetList.vue`
**Changes:**
- Removed `autoOpenCreate` prop definition
- Removed `props` parameter from setup function
- Removed auto-open logic from onMounted hook
- Cleaned up unused imports

**Before:**
```vue
props: {
  autoOpenCreate: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  }
},
setup(props) {
  // ...
  onMounted(async () => {
    await Promise.all([categoryStore.fetchCategories(), loadBudgets()])
    if (props.autoOpenCreate) {
      showCreateModal.value = true
    }
  })
}
```

**After:**
```vue
setup() {
  // ...
  onMounted(async () => {
    await Promise.all([categoryStore.fetchCategories(), loadBudgets()])
  })
}
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Normal Navigation
1. Navigate to Budgets page
2. Click "Manage Budgets" tab
3. **Expected:** Modal should NOT open automatically
4. **Result:** ✅ Modal stays closed

### Test Case 2: Manual Modal Opening
1. Go to "Manage Budgets" tab
2. Click "Create New Budget" button
3. **Expected:** Modal opens
4. **Result:** ✅ Modal opens correctly

### Test Case 3: Quick Action (if still needed)
1. Navigate to `/budgets?action=create`
2. **Expected:** Switches to "Manage Budgets" tab (without opening modal)
3. **Result:** ✅ Tab switches, modal stays closed

## Impact
- ✅ **Bug Fixed:** Modal no longer auto-opens
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes:** All other functionality remains intact
- ✅ **Improved UX:** Users have more control over when the modal appears
- ✅ **Cleaner Code:** Removed unnecessary prop passing and logic

## Status
**FIXED** ✅
